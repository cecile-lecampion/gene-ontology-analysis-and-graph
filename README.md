# Automatically format Gene ontology data for graphical representation with R

The script `prepare_gene_onthology.pl` formats Gene Ontology data for graphical representation with R according to the protocole describe by Bonnot et al, 2019.

It comes with a set-up `TerminalUnixSetup.exe`, to install minimal Unix terminal on Windows, 2 R scripts and 2 manuals `gene-ontology_FR.md` and `gene-ontology_EN.md`, one in french and one in English. The french manual is dedicated to newbies.
